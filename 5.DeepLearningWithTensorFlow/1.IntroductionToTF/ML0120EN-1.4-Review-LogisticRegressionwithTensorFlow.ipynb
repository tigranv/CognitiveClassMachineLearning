    "## What is different between Linear and Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it isn’t the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate a classification, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the **most probable class** for that data point. For this, we use **Logistic Regression**.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, _y_, to some predictors (independent variables _x1_, _x2_, etc.). Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = w0 + w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 +...\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and finds the values of _w0_, _w1_, _w2_, etc. The term _w0_ is the \"intercept\" or \"constant term\" (it's shown as _b_ in the formula below):\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = WX + b\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, _y_, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the name logistic _regression_, it is actually a __probabilistic classification__ model. Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{e^y}{1+e^y} = exp(y) / (1+exp(y)) = p \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which produces p-values between 0 (as y approaches minus infinity) and 1 (as y approaches plus infinity). This now becomes a special kind of non-linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, _y_ is the regression result (the sum of the variables weighted by the coefficients), `exp` is the exponential function and $\\theta(y)$ is the [logistic function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function), also called logistic curve. It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve), and was first developed for modelling population growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also have seen this function before, in another configuration:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "ProbabilityOfaClass = \\theta(y) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\n",
